% generate markdown and then pdf and GitHub wiki docu-
% mentation from function helpdocs. You can see example
% documentation at [link]. By default function name string
% even if bold (EEGDB_HELPDOC) get transformed to markdown
% code-like characters (`db_helpdoc`). Also short matlab-
% style strings like 'short string' are transformed to 
% `'short string'`. 
% There are also specific rules go-
% verning usage of spaces in blank lines. See db_blanks
% for a table of rules. The rules specify how next helpdoc
% block is interpreted and parsed to markdown.
