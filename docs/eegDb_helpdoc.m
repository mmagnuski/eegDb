% in eegDb project. This is the first helpdoc block that
% contains general description of the function. It should
% not be longer than this description - short and consise.

% If more detail needs to be provided - it goes here, in
% the seconds block of the helpdocs. This block allows 
% for more lengthy description. Like stating that
% EEG_HELPDOC rules are needed to quickly and painlessly
% generate markdown and then pdf and GitHub wiki docu-
% mentation from function helpdocs. You can see example
% documentation at [link]. By default function name string
% even if bold (EEGDB_HELPDOC) get transformed to markdown
% code-like characters (`eegDb_helpdoc`). Also short matlab-
% style strings like 'short string' are transformed to 
% `'short string'`. 
% There are also specific rules go-
% verning usage of spaces in blank lines. See eegDb_blanks
% for a table of rules. The rules specify how next helpdoc
% block is interpreted and parsed to markdown.
